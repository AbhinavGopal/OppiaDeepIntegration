        <p>As Matthew entered the bakery, a kind-looking man looked up from the counter and smiled at him.

            Mr. Baker
            "Hello!" he said. "My name’s Mr. Baker. What would you like today?"
            "The coconut cake in the window!" Matthew answered.
            “The whole cake?" asked Mr. Baker.
            "Ummmm.... no," said Matthew. He knew how to ask for one, or two, or three cakes. But he didn’t want the whole cake. He just wanted part of it.
            “You know,” Mr. Baker said kindly. “I can cut a small piece for you, if you like. Just tell me how much. What fraction of the cake would you like?”
