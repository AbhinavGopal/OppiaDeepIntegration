        <p> Matthew looked confused. "What's a fraction?" he asked.
            "Ah," said Mr. Baker. "That just means how much of the whole thing you want.” He picked up a napkin and a pencil. “Look,” he said, starting to draw.
            A circle divided into equal fifths.
            “Here’s a cake. Pretend it’s divided into five equal parts, OK? Since there are five equal parts, each part is called a fifth.”
            Then he picked up a colored pencil and colored in one of the parts.
            “napkin sketch” of circle divided into fifths with one section shaded in red
            “Now look, Matthew. If I asked you how many parts of the cake were colored red, we could say one fifth. Because one of the fifths is colored in.”
            Then he colored in another piece.
            “napkin sketch” of circle divided into fifths with two sections shaded in red
            “Now, two fifths of the cake are red. Both ‘one fifth’ and ‘two fifths’ are fractions, because they tell us how much of a whole thing we’re talking about.
            “Now here’s an easy question for you,” said Mr. Baker, coloring another part of the cake. "Look at the picture below. How many fifths are colored red now?"
